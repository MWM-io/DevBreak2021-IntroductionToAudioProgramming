## Introduction to audio programming

Audio and music are everywhere in our everyday life: at home, at work, when we go shopping, in our cars etc. The vast majority of the apps on our mobile devices use audio in some way, and yet, most of us programmers are not aware of the ins and outs of audio programming. In this workshop, we will introduce you to the challenges audio programmers face daily. 

The objective of the workshop will be to code simple audio applications in C/C++ to play around with sound, music and audio effects.

This workshop is animated by [MWM](http://musicworldmedia.com/), world's leading mobile creative apps publisher, as part of the [DevBreak festival 2021](https://www.devbreak.io/).
